# Graph system

Graph is an important concept in Hinterweld.

A graph is a set of edges and nodes.
Characters move along graphs.
Graphs are serializable.
We're going to have the Graph Editor.

The characters move from a graph to another. Graphs are connected at the specific points.
The chars go into the point and appear in the other point in another graph.

A Node can have a person, a thing, etc.
The chars take actions on them.
